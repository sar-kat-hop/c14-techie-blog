# Tech Blog (Challenge 14)

## About

Note: This app is still a WIP and not functioning as intended.

This is a basic CMS-style blog/forum where visitors can view comments on the homepage. Users can register for an account, which will allow them to make, edit, and delete posts. The app will authenticate the user and makes use of express sessions, handlebars, mysql, and sequelize. 

The database and seeds are functional. Getting and rendering the seeded comments on the homepage, logging in, and creating/editing/deleting posts are not. 

## Installation

Please note that ss of 2/12, the deployments aren't working. Better results may be possible with local testing. 

Click on the links under the Environments section on the right side of the page to visit the GitHub Pages and Heroku deployments (once functional).
