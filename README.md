# Tech Blog (Challenge 14)

## About

*Note: This app is still a WIP and not functioning as intended.*

This is a basic CMS-style blog/forum where visitors will be able to view comments on the homepage. Users will be able to register for an account, which will allow them to make, edit, and delete posts. The app will authenticate the user and makes use of express sessions, handlebars, mysql, and sequelize. 

## Installation
